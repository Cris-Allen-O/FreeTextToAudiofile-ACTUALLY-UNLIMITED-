- Made using python (I forgot the other components actually)
- This is kinda lag 
- I made this as a practice project with the help of chatgpt
- if you paste a lot of text it will take a while so just let it finish it is not broken don't worry it's just slow lol
- The output/mp3 file is located on the folder of the exe and the README, or to put it simply it's basically in the same directory as the "TextToAudioFree" exe file.
